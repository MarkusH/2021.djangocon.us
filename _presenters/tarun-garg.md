I'm currently working as Engineering Manager at SquadStack, I've been here for the past 5 years and have seen the team and processes grow from 3 member engineering team to a now ~60 people engineering team. Being the early member of the engineering team, I got to experience a fair share of challenges and make a lot of mistakes along the way and that's why I wanted to share those learnings so that other people don't make those same mistakes and the community keeps on growing :D.

- More about me? Well, I'm a passionate, responsible, and committed engineer with ~5 years of experience, the majority of it being in a fast-paced startup, where I got the experience to identify, prioritize and solve products, engineering, and people challenges and move things regularly from inception to production. *Built things with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Celery & Empathy till now.*
