Thanks for the instructions on everything. For the video, is it acceptable if it's just a screen recording of the presentation with me presenting into a mic? Or is it more common for presenters to also include a video of themselves in the bottom corner of the video? I can do either one, just wasn't sure if there might be a typical format people follow
