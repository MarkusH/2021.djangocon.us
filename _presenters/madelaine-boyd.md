Madelaine is at bit.io building an immediately productive, shareable cloud database. Previously, she led a team to improve the end-to-end containerization, deployment, and orchestration of Facebook’s private cloud. She’s worked on everything from mobile infrastructure and compilers, to front-end product, even building software to tune, fit, and program hearing aids. Madelaine's technical accomplishment of which she is most proud was when she changed her job title to zalgo text and broke Facebook HR's data pipelines. She once won a rap battle by rhyming with "vim."
