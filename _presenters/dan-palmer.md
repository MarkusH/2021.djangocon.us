Iâ€™m a software engineer living in London. I enjoy writing software to solve interesting problems and improving engineering culture and processes.

Since 2014 I've been an engineer at Thread working on core product features, APIs, payments, integration with partners, and tools. I'm currently mostly working with Python/Django, GraphQL APIs, and Swift on iOS.
