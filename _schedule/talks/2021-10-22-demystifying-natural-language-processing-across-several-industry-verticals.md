Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the ability of a machine to understand human language. NLP is a popular field of data science and is widely used across different industry verticals to solve for various challenges. This talk will highlight NLP, what it is and will follow into how 5+ industries use NLP to solve for their use cases. The industries include retail, finance, real estate, entertainment, marketing and more. 
This talk will then progress into some practical implementations of the common industrial solutions that are widely used across the globe today. These applications include chatbots and automated customer service solutions, and recommendation engines. Furthermore, using open-source libraries to build these NLP utilizations will be discussed and presented.
